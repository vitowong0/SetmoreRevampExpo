# SetmoreRevampExpo
Final project for Computer Science 4474 - Human Computer Interaction, at Western University.

Our project is to improve the user's experience with _Setmore_, a popular service booking app. We want to make it easier for the customer to browse, select, and book appointments. At the moment, they lack a customer app - so we are creating one. 

## Installation
We are using React Native with Expo for cross-platform functionality. We set up our app using the instructions for _Expo Go Quickstart_.

Follow the documentation here, although it's not necessary to run our app: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

## Usage
1. Download the _Expo Go_ app from your phone's App Store. A login is **not** required for this to work. 

2. Clone this repo onto your local machine. 

3. In your terminal, `cd` into `SetmoreRevampExpo`, and then again into `cd SetmoreRevampExpo`. (Sorry I goofed the cloning). To ensure you're in the right place, when you run `pwd`, you should get: `whatever/SetmoreRevampExpo/SetmoreRevampExpo`.

4. In the same terminal, run `npx expo start`. You may be asked something about using alternate ports, just type `y`. Metro Bundler should start, a QR code should appear, and some text should show below. Don't close this terminal window as it will be used for all outputs.

5. The easiest way is to run this via Expo Go. On an iPhone, open the Camera app and scan the given QR code. On an Android, open Expo Go and use the built in QR code scanner.

6. Happy booking!
