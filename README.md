# SetmoreRevampExpo
Final project for Computer Science 4474 - Human Computer Interaction, at Western University.

Our project is to improve the user's experience with _Setmore_, a popular service booking app. We want to make it easier for the customer to browse, select, and book appointments. At the moment, they lack a customer app - so we are creating one. 

## Installation
We are using React Native with Expo for cross-platform functionality. We set up our app using the instructions for _Expo Go Quickstart_.

Follow the documentation here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

## Usage
1. Clone this repo onto your local machine. 

2. In your IDE of choice, we used Visual Studio Code, `cd` into `./SetmoreRevampExpo`. To ensure you're in the right place, when you run `pwd`, you should get: `whatever/SetmoreRevampExpo/SetmoreRevampExpo`.

2. Open a new terminal of your choice within your IDE and run `npx expo start`. Assuming you followed the above environment setup documentation, Expo should begin. This terminal will show all warnings and errors, and any console.log() from our app will appear here.

    **- Use your device:** With an iPhone, open the Camera app and follow the QR code. With an Android, download _Expo Go_, and follow the instructions there. This QR code will allow you to run our app on your device, while using your IDE's terminal to output text.

    **- Android simulator:** Press a

3. If you launch via simulator, you may get errors saying you are missing packages. For example, you may be missing the _react-native-reanimated_ package. To install this package, a quick Google search shows the command to be: `npm install react-native-reanimated`. This tends to be the case for most missing packages.

4. After successful install of all packages, the app should launch onto its Home Screen.
